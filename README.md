## 🛠️ Setup

### 🐍 Python Environment

1. Navigate to the project root directory:

   ```bash
   cd spring-2026-group4
   ```
2. Create a virtual environment:

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   ```
3. Activate the virtual environment:

   ```bash
   source venv/bin/activate   # Linux / macOS
   ```
4. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### 📦 Dataset Setup

1. Download the dataset from Hugging Face:
   👉 [Multimodal Financial Time-Series Dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/Wenyan0110/Multimodal-Dataset-Image_Text_Table_TimeSeries-for-Financial-Time-Series-Forecasting)
2. You can also download the dataset by running a script
   ```bash
   chmod +x setup_dataset.sh
   ./setup_dataset
   ```
   this script will save the dataset in required format and skip the 3rd step

3. Save the dataset under the `data/` directory at the project root, following this structure:

```text
data/
└── multi-modal-dataset/
    ├── sp500_news/                     # News articles related to S&P 500 stocks
    ├── sp500_time_series/              # Time-series financial data for S&P 500 stocks
    ├── sp500stock_data_description.csv # Metadata and feature descriptions
    └── stock_scores_news_1.csv         # Computed stock scores based on news data
```

4. If your dataset is stored in a different location, update the paths in:

   ```
   config/config.yaml
   ```

5. From the project root directory, run the following command to generate the stock score file:

   ```bash
   python -m setupScripts.cal_data_quality_scores
   ```

   This will generate:

   ```
   data/multi-modal-dataset/stock_scores_news_1.csv
   ```

### ⚙️ Configuration Notes

* All dataset paths are centrally managed via `config/config.yaml`.
* Avoid hardcoding paths in scripts; update the config file instead if the dataset location changes.
